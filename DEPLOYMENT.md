# EcoLens Deployment Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Ready for Deployment** - EcoLens is fully functional and ready to deploy!

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Replit Deployment (Recommended)
**Easiest and fastest way to deploy:**

1. **Click Deploy Button**: In your Replit, click the "Deploy" button in the top toolbar
2. **Choose Plan**: Select a deployment plan (Free tier available)
3. **Deploy**: Your app will be live at `https://your-app-name.replit.app`
4. **Automatic Updates**: Any changes you make will auto-deploy

**Benefits:**
- Zero configuration required
- Automatic SSL certificates
- Global CDN
- Easy custom domain setup
- Built-in monitoring

### Option 2: Firebase Hosting (Advanced)
**If you prefer Google's infrastructure:**

1. **Install Firebase CLI**: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. **Login**: `firebase login`
3. **Build**: `npm run build`
4. **Deploy**: `firebase deploy`

**Note**: Firebase hosting is configured but optional since Replit deployment is simpler.

## Next Steps After Deployment
1. **Test on mobile devices** - The app is optimized for mobile
