## Data Flow

1. **Camera Capture**: User captures image through camera interface
2. **AI Processing**: Image sent to AI detection service (Teachable Machine/Clarifai)
3. **Results Processing**: Detection results mapped to recyclable categories and rewards
4. **Database Storage**: Detection and transaction records saved to PostgreSQL
5. **UI Updates**: Real-time updates to user balance and transaction history
6. **Reward Redemption**: QR code generation for spending coins at partner locations

## External Dependencies

### AI Services
- **@teachablemachine/image**: Primary AI detection service

### Database & Storage
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL database provider
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations and migrations
- **connect-pg-simple**: PostgreSQL session storage

### UI & Styling
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible, unstyled UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **class-variance-authority**: Type-safe variant management
- **lucide-react**: Icon library

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Build tool with HMR and optimized bundling
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking across the entire stack

## Deployment Strategy

### Replit Deployment (Recommended)
- **One-Click Deploy**: Use Replit's built-in deployment system
- **Automatic SSL**: HTTPS enabled by default
- **Custom Domain**: Optional .replit.app domain or custom domain
- **Zero Configuration**: No additional setup required

### Firebase Hosting (Optional)
- **Static Hosting**: Firebase configuration files included
- **Global CDN**: Fast worldwide content delivery
- **Custom Domains**: Easy domain management
- **Setup**: Use `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc` configuration files

### Build Process
- **Client Build**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
- **Server Build**: ESBuild bundles Express server to `dist/index.js`
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit manages PostgreSQL schema migrations

### Environment Configuration
- **Firebase**: `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
- **AI Services**: `VITE_TEACHABLE_MACHINE_MODEL_URL`, `VITE_CLARIFAI_API_KEY`
- **Development**: Local development with Vite dev server proxy
- **Production**: Static file serving with Express for SPA routing

### Performance Optimizations
- **Code Splitting**: Vite automatic code splitting for optimal loading
- **Image Optimization**: Client-side image compression before AI processing
- **Caching**: TanStack Query with infinite stale time for optimal UX
- **Bundle Size**: Tree shaking and modern JavaScript targeting

The application uses a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript types and schemas, enabling type safety across the full stack while maintaining clear separation between client and server concerns.
